The rapid evolution of the digital world brings both advantages and disadvantages. Among the challenges is the proliferation of fake news, easily disseminated through online platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, offers promise in addressing this issue. By employing various algorithms, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, researchers aim to detect and combat fake news effectively.
