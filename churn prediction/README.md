This project demonstrates how to build a customer churn prediction model using Keras with a neural network. 
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company's product or service. 
Predicting customer churn can help businesses identify potential churners in advance and take proactive measures to retain them.

In this project, we will:

1 * Preprocess data for use in a neural network.
2 * Build a neural network using Keras.
3 * Train and evaluate the model's performance.
